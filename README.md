# Block Breaker

https://nathandroberts.github.io/sparta-project1-jsgame/

A fast paced randomly generated block breaking game made using javascript css and html.

The aim of the game is to use a mouse controlled paddle to destroy blocks by bouncing a ball into them. Win by destroying all blocks before your lives run out. Allowing the main ball to go out of play will decrease your lives until you reach game over.

Control the direction and angle the ball bounces to by changing its point of contact with the paddle.

Features implemented include different screens, background music, sound effects, a balanced ratio of different block types and spawning of up to two additional balls.

## Most Pleased with
The randomly generated blocks created at the start of the game helps to make each game feel different increasing replayability.

Careful balance of difficulty modifiers and negative-positive block types help the game to feel fun and slightly challenging but still clearable with a little skill.

## Challenges
Learning to use code within the HTML canvas within a two day period.

# Sparta Core Project 1 Brief

Congratulation Spartans for making it through your first two weeks of training!

To consolidate your learning, your task is to produce a project using any and all of the technology that you have learnt within the past two weeks.

>**You must successfully pass this project in order to graduate the Sparta Academy**

## Task

Your mission, should you choose to accept it! Is to build a **browser based game!** Your game should be built using html, css and JavaScript!

**The choice of game is totally up to you however before you get to work, you must ensure you have had your project idea approved by one of your trainers.**

Your game must:

* Include an instruction section explaining how to play the game.
* Ether display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
* Be styled to perfection!
* Be hosted online!

**BONUS**

* Your game could include a leaderboard.
* Your game could be 2 player.
* Your game could be played against the computer...
* You could include some fancy animations in your game...
* You could into HTML5 Audio and include some snazzy sound effects...

---
**ReadMe**
You MUST have a detailed readme.md file documenting the entire project including a section detailing how to get the app up and running.

An example of a good project readme, written by Matt Calthrop (A previous Sparta Trainer) can be found here: https://github.com/mcalthrop/angular-spa-demo


---
**Presentation**
You will be required to prepare a small 5 minute presentation based around your project. This will be followed by a 5 minute Q&A.

**We will be assessing you on the quality of your presentation, make sure you plan in time to prepare a high quality side deck.**

## File Structure

Make sure that you're file structure is setup appropriately. Separate out all your Javascript, Css and images into their own independent files. e.i.

```
+-- project-one
|	+--js
|		--main.js
|	+--css
|		--style.css
|	+--images
|	--index.html
```

## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to:

* To pull everything together by building a small web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.
* To demonstrate the quality of communication around your decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.

You will be working **individually** for this project! So show us what you've got!

## Planning

We strongly advise that you take the time to plan your project well. You should include all planning, wireframes, skatches etc in your presentation.

#### Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?

* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work and link between each other. Again, pen and aper works great. You can also check out wire framing software like Protoshare or Balsamic.

* **Milestones.** We will give you some dates and milestones to help keep you on track. Outline some specific milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.



## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-commented. Will anyone else quickly understand what is going on in your application?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Fully git tracked with dev and master branches with your trainers added as collaborators with an acceptable amount of git comments.

We’ll also be looking at:

* How you work together as a team.
* How you support yourself and each other to achieve a common goal.
